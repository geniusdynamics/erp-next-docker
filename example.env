# --- ERPNext Environment Variables ---

# Enable automatic site creation on container start/restart
# Set to "true" or "false"
ENABLE_AUTO_SITE=true

# Comma-separated list of sites to create if ENABLE_AUTO_SITE is true
# Example: SITES=site1.localhost,site2.example.com
SITES=myerp.localhost

# Admin password for newly created sites
ADMIN_PASS=admin

# --- Database Settings (MariaDB) ---
# These are used by Frappe/ERPNext to connect to the database.
# The MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is for the MariaDB container itself.
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
# DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD for the Frappe sites are managed internally by Frappe
# after `bench new-site` using the root credentials provided below for site creation.
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=admin

# --- Redis Settings ---
# Used by Frappe/ERPNext to connect to Redis instances.
REDIS_CACHE=redis://redis-cache:6379
REDIS_QUEUE=redis://redis-queue:6379
# REDIS_SOCKETIO often defaults to the same as REDIS_QUEUE if not specified.

# --- Frappe Specific Settings ---
# Header used by Nginx/proxy to determine the site for the request.
# Default is usually $host, which works well when Nginx is proxying.
FRAPPE_SITE_NAME_HEADER=myerp.localhost # Should match one of the SITES, or use $$host if using a proxy that sets Host correctly

# Port for Frappe Socket.IO service
SOCKETIO_PORT=9000

# --- Optional: For APPS_JSON_BASE64 ---
# If you want to pass apps.json as a base64 encoded string for image build (less common now with APPS_JSON_URL and local apps.json)
# APPS_JSON_BASE64=

# --- Docker Compose Specific ---
# You can define the image and tag to use here if you prefer
# ERPNEXT_IMAGE_NAME=geniusdynamics/erpnext-ns8
